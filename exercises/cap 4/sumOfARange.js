/* The introduction of this book alluded to the following as a nice way to compute the sum of a range of numbers:
console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));
Write a range function that takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.
Next, write a sum function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers. Run the previous program and see whether it does indeed return 55.*/

range(start, end) {
 let array=[];
 array.push();
}

range(1, 10);
