## Introduction

## 1. Values, Types, and Operators

> “Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without
effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter
and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water.
The essence stays invisibly below.”
—Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming

### Values
To create a value, you must merely invoke its name.
Every value has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use
a gigantic amount of them at the same time, you might run out of memory.
Fortunately, this is a problem only if you need them all simultaneously.

### Numbers
Values of the number type are, unsurprisingly, numeric values.
```javascript
13
```
Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.
```javascript
9.81
```
For very big or very small numbers, you may also use scientific notation by
adding an “e” (for “exponent”), followed by the exponent of the number:
```javascript
2.998e8
```
That is 2.998 × 10 8 = 299,800,000.
Calculations with whole numbers (also called integers) are guaranteed to always be precise.
Be aware of it and treat fractional digital numbers as
approximations, not as precise values.
